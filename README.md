### **Conclusion**  

The analysis underscores the influence of both regional and seasonal factors on overall sales performance. Major metropolitan areas like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City emerged as key revenue drivers, while smaller markets such as Austin and Portland contributed less to overall sales.
